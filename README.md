# Problems

## Have changable Staker address on the Rent

I was thinking that one of the problem could be that before chaning the staker address we need to check if the stakerFeeBalance is === 0 otherwise there will be problem calculating the share price value

## Should we support multiple NFT stake/unstake?

## Do I need to track the deposited amount and give back the amount + reward or just the share value?

## Should someone be able to rent even if there's no staked pass?

# TODO

- [ ] Add more tests on rent.ts
